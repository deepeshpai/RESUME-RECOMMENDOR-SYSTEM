It is then trained using minimization of a novel feature evaluation index in an unsupervised manner. The effectiveness of the proposed network, in evaluating selected features, is demonstrated on several real life data sets. Projects : 1.  Forecasting using ARIMA  model for time series data : This study gives an inside view of the application of ARIMA time series model to forecast the future price of gold based on past data. 2. Universal Language Model Fine-tuning for spam classification (under Prof. Kumar Shankar Ray, at ECSU Unit, ISI   Kolkata) :   ULMFiT is an effective transfer learning method in NLP. It introduces techniques that are the keys for fine-tuning a language model. Our method significantly outperforms the state of the art of text classification tasks, reducing the amount of error.
